Phase 1: The "Aha!" Moment (Seconds 0–10)
Goal: Prove the app works before asking for an email address. 

Show a blank canvas with a prompt: "Scribble any math problem here (e.g., 2x + 5 = 11)."

The Action: As soon as they stop writing, the 2-minute timer (or a 5-second "demo" timer) triggers.

The Result: Gemini Vision converts their handwriting to beautiful LaTeX on-screen and gives one helpful hint.

The Feeling: The student feels "This is magic," not "This is a form to fill out."

Phase 2: Privacy-First Consent (Seconds 10–20)
Goal: Now that they want the app, explain the rules. Since you are dealing with students, you must address COPPA (USA) and GDPR-K (Europe).

Screen 2: The Transparency Card. A clean, non-legalese popup.

"We respect your brain and your data."

Point 1: We don't store your handwriting images after they are processed.

Point 2: We use the "Paid Tier" of Gemini, meaning Google never uses your homework to train its AI.

Point 3: (If under 13) "Grab a parent to help you finish setting up."

[!IMPORTANT] 2026 Privacy Standard: You must provide a "Data Nutrition Label." This is a simple table showing exactly what data is collected (e.g., "Handwriting: Processed only," "Contact: Email for progress sync").

Phase 3: Personalization (Seconds 20–30)
Goal: Make the "Tutor" feel like it belongs to them.

Screen 3: Level & Style.

Grade Level: (Middle School, High School, College). This tells Gemini whether to explain things like a peer or a professor.

Learning Mode: Choose between "The Encourager" (gentle hints) or "The Challenger" (harder practice problems).
